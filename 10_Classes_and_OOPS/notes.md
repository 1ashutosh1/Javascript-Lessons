# Javascript and Classes
JavaScript does contain classes. However, prior to the introduction of ECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES6), JavaScript did not have built-in class support. Instead, developers typically used prototype-based inheritance to achieve similar functionality.

With the introduction of ES6 in 2015, JavaScript gained native support for classes, allowing developers to define classes using a more familiar syntax similar to other object-oriented programming languages like Java or C++.
